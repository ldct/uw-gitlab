# Compilation

There are no changes relative to the default premake4/make combination. Hence, from the directory where this README exists, the following steps build and run the program.

```
cd ..
premake4 gmake
make
cd -
premake4 gmake
make
./A0
```

# Manual

The CLI will signal if an unrecognized key is pressed.

In the UI for controlling the rotation angle, the angle is given in radians between 0 and 2Ï€.

The program is tested with an OS-level dvorak keyboard (Ubuntu and Ubuntu-on-WSL), but the keys specified in the assignment only work with the unmapped qwerty keys.

Pressing the key that has "+" printed on it interpreted as a "+" command, regardless of whether the shift key is currently pressed.

The scale-up command increases the linear scale of the shape by 10%, and the scale-down command decreases the linear scale by 10%.
